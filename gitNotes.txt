git update-index --add file1 file2
# add untracked to tracked

# added based on unique content
# same content files will have commit in same folder
# 	aka -> objects/same_folder/zipFile

# object id is folder name appended with that index update
# total aah itll be 40 bytes, with the first 2 from directory name


git cat-file object_id -pts
print content, type, size

# Objects are immutable/they exist forecer once created

git diff-files 
# internal representation of change

git write-tree
# creates tree

## OBJECTS ##

#blobs are git adds
#trees are git commits

git commit-tree
#requires current tree, parent commit tree, commit msg 
#first 2 params as object names

#git commit-tree also wants to get a commit message on its standard input,
#only param requires tree and parent tree

COMMIT SEQUENCE

tree=$(git write-tree)
commit=$(echo 'Initial commit' | git commit-tree $tree)
git update-ref HEAD $commit
-p to give parent

git diff-index INDEX_NAME
#shows diff between working tree and tree at INDEX
aka 
git diff INDEX
#using --cached allows to diff with INDEX ignoring staged changes


-----------

git diff-tree DON HEAD -p --pretty
#diff between any commit trees

git tag TAG_NAME
#writes HEAD To .git/refs/tags/TAG_NAME
